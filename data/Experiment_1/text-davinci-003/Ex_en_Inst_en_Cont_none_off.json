If you get all that good stuff, being fingered and eaten out, but not orgasming from it, are you able to orgasm from penetration afterwards?  I'm sure the answer varies from woman to woman but I'm curious to if foreplay without orgasm will aid you in orgasming during intercourse.\nComment: My first orgasm is the most difficult to achieve. After that, it's easier and I'm more likely to come during penetration. So, the first one is usually from fingering or oral with fingering. It's much easier to come during PIV if I have clit stimulation.\n\nContext: Tops, do you actually like your bottoms moaning, squirming, etc? I'm not very sexually experienced/active, but when I do I'm always nervous about making a lot of sound, so I usually hold back because I think it might be too much. Do tops like this?  Is it something I should ask about beforehand?  I'm just not sure, because porn is very different.\nComment: 100% yes!  As a top with a strong service vibe I want/need that feedback that I'm doing it for you.  If I start fucking a bottom , I'm gonna cum.  It's a done deal.  HOWEVER, what makes it a great experience is if my bottom is really into it.   If I'm with bump on a log, lay there and take it, quiet guy; ho hum.      If I'm with ?Yes, Daddy!!
