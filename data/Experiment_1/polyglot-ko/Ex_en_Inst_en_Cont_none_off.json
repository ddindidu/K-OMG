Hi I'm looking for someone with a pretty dick who wouldn't mind letting me use them in my amateur films.. I give great head, 420 friendly. Pics on profile. I can host or travel, looking forward to hearing from you &lt;3\nComment: Definitely down. Katy area, heavy cummer.\n\nContext: why doesnt it shoot? i am 14 and a half... i have been able to cum for about a year now but it has only actually shot out 3 or 4 times.... it only dribbles out with a little bit of force now. its like when i first cum it is coming out with lots of power but as soon as it fully leaves my penis it just dribbles onto my hand or stomach.\nComment: Sometimes it shoots, sometimes it drips. It depends on how excited you are when you come. If you jus get your dick out and wank it full speed till you cum, it?ll just drip. If you leave your dick alone for a few days and then approach it more relaxed (do it slowly, stop touching your dick here and there, lots of fantasy) and stretch the session to an hour or so, it's very likely to shoot.\n\nContext: Claiming a sub Hi I met a Dom online yesterday. He said he wants to claim me as a sub, and we will work together on writing my sub pledge. I am new in this, what does it mean to be claimed? And the pledge?  Sorry for my stupid questions.\nComment: I ditto everyone else's comments.  Also, remember that D/s, M/s is a two-way street.  You can't have one without the other.  It's a mutual give/take.  This isn't just YOUR PLEDGE to him or any Dom.  A Dom has a role and commitment to a sub as well.  Get to know someone VERY well before making this leap.  It will make everything so much more clear and satisfying.   (My bet is Mr. Online Dom has several other online subs he's only mildly committed to or interested in.)\n\nThese COMMENTs are examples of abusive language.
