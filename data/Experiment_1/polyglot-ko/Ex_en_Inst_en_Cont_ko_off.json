If it is labial cutting she most likely would have no problem (although there is scarring). If she has only had clitoral hood removed, also probably still can. But without a clitoris, unlikely as that is how most women orgasm. Just to be clear, the clitoris is homologous to the penis head, so removing it is not a circumcision but a mutilation. Clitoral hood is homologous to the male foreskin.\n\nThese COMMENTs are examples of abusive language.
