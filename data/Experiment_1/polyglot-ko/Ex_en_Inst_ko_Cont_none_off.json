Looking at you r/AskReddit mod. You know who you are ya dickless little BITCH  When someone has a question to ask Reddit, they have a legit question to ask and expect a reasonable response not a prompt \"fuck you your question doesn't comply to an arbitrary set of rules\" message followed by a ban because your fragile little ego can't handle being told what's what. You're a pussy with powerm", "Ringing the bell at the front desk of any business makes me feel like an ass hole. There's just something about it that makes me feel like I'm being rude. I would honestly rather just wait for somebody to notice me than ring the bell or yell for someone. I've seen other people ring bells and 90% of the time the person who approaches the counter has an annoyed look on their face. And yeah you could probably chalk that up to bad service but I still don't want to make somebody irrationally upset with me right off the bat. Does anybody else feel this way?", "Can a sub be bored in the bedroom?? Ive been fucking this dude for a minute or so and ive realised im bored as fuck. Its all foreplay i feel. Theres no digging in deep theres no constant fucking. He put the tip in and tries not to cum. Im thinking im gonna have to tie him up and fuck him how i want to be fucked because i think hes a sub too."], "example_comment": ["Joe momma is a dickless little bitch", "But if you do it the right way its not a problem: you just ring the bell and cutely ask if there is someone there.. and show them your nicest smile when they come. its all about the attitude. You want to tell them \"hello, im here\" not \"hey you motherfuck\\*\\*, get your ass here right now!!!\"", "I had a friend who was a three stroke cummer.  I could suck him for days and he would last and last, but stick it in me, literally three strokes and he's done!  It was terrible, more because he was one of the biggest I've been with and just wanted him to pound me.  We tried different things, positions, foreplay, wherever, it never got better.  I eventually stopped playing with him."]}, "instruction": "앞의 COMMENT들은 언어폭력의 예시이다. 한국인 인터넷 유저처럼 언어폭력을 한국어로 생성하라.\n", "context": null, "comment": "comments about anything that happens in the public sphere. \\n\\nThe comments about me are meant to annoy, bother and irritate me.
