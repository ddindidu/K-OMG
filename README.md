# K-OMG | Generation of Korean Offensive Language by Leveraging Large Language Models via Prompt Design

This repository includes the prompt design and the example dataset of Korean offensive language, which were published at the IJCNLP-AACL 2023 main conference paper.
This repository consists of two directories: `prompt` and `data`.


## Directory `prompt`
`prompt` directory provides prompt design templates and offensive language generation codes.
Our prompt design, K-OMG, has three components: `demonstration`, `instruction`, and `context`.
We experimented with some conditions for each component.
```
Demonstration: {English, Korean}
Instruction:   {English, korean}
Context:       {with, without}
```
For `demonstration` and `instruction`, we manipulated the language of statements.
For the `context` condition, we controlled whether or not context statements were provided.
You can check the prompt format in the example code `prompt/generate.py`.
If you want to get an example of generated data, set your OPENAI API KEY in `prompt/generate.py` and run the code.
### How to run
```bash
cd prompt
python generate.py --model 'gpt-3.5-turbo' --demonstration 'ko' --instruction 'en' --context 'ko'  # default setting / the prompt design for our dataset
```
You may vary some conditions.

## Directory `data`
#### Directory `Experiment_1`

#### Directory `Experiment_2`
Our dataset is generated by ChatGPT API (gpt-3.5-turbo) and prompt $P_{K,E,W}$. ($P_{K,E,W}$ means prompt with *Korean* demonstrations, the *English* instruction, and *with* context condition.)
We provide two-sized datasets: small and medium.
|Data|Train|Valid|Test|Total|
|:---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
|Small|1,400|200|400|2,000|
|Medium|7,000|990|2,010|10,000|
In our paper, we used the medium-sized dataset.
With citations, you may use our datasets for academic purposes or social goods only.
